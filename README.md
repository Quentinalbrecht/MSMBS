# Assignment 1: Metabolic Modeling (E. coli Core)
 In this assignment, we work with the E. coli core metabolic model using COBRApy in Python. Our goal is to see how gene expression data can affect the model by using it as a proxy for the maximum activity of certain reactions.  
We first visualize the gene expression data on the E. coli core map and then use it to set new flux bounds for the reactions. After building the constrained model, we run Flux Variability Analysis to find the possible flux ranges for all reactions. Lastly, we perform Flux Balance Analysis to calculate the maximum biomass production rate and figure out which reactions are acting as bottlenecks for growth.
